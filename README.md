# Party Playlist

This app uses the spotify API to allow multiple users to contribute to the same playlist through a web interface

This app uses .env to store keys. To get it working, you'll need to create both a spotify and facebook api account as well as a .env file in your root directory with the following variables.

```.env
FACEBOOK_ID=123
FACEBOOK_SECRET=123
SPOTIFY_ID=132
SPOTIFY_SECRET=123
```
